# Spark Structured Streaming Example

Demonstrates how to use Spark Structured streaming.

## What is Spark Structured Streaming?

Structured Streaming is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine.
It builds on top of Apache Spark to provided a unified interface to batch and
streaming processing.

TL;DR the engineer shouldn't have to think about how to make a pipeline
"streaming". Rather, streaming should interpret the more naturally expressed
batch processing definition and run it in a just-in-time manner.
